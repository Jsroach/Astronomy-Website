<h2 class="facts">Mercury Monday (May 9th, 2016)</h2>
<article class="facts">
    
<p class="facts">On Monday, May 9th, as Mercury orbited as usual around the sun, it passed over the surface of the sun visible to Earth. 
The last time Mercury passed directly between the sun and earth, was on November 8th, 2006, and the next time it will do this will be on 
November 11th, 2019. On this day, it was possible to see the planet crossing over the sun's surface through the use of binoculars or a 
telescope. This event only occurs around 13 times every century. This type of transit is more unique than the more common occurrences that take place
during November, as Mercury is closer to earth during the May transits and therefore more easily visible.</p>

<h2 class="facts">Gravitational Waves</h2>
<article class="facts">
    <h3 class="tess">On September 14th, 2015, gravity waves were detected for the first time. If you think this is just a normal 
    day in science, think again. Up until this day, gravity was only a theory, and only now with these waves have we been able to 
    prove that it exists. The video below, originating <a href="www.phdcomics.com">here</a>, 
    does a fantastic job at explaining gravity in a simple, easy to understand, and entertaining manner.</h3>
