1,Space,"Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. It is the volume of the universe and contains all of the known objects, matter, and mass in the universe. It is easily represented through a coordinate plane with three axis.",http://www.bt-images.net/incredible-universe/,explore1.jpg
2,Time,"Time is an indefinite continued progression of existence and events that occur in what is believed to be irreversible succession. It consists of the past - time that has already occurred, present - time that is currently occurring, and future - time that has yet to occur. Time is also referred to as the 4th dimension of space (a fourth axis on the 3 axis coordinate plane). The shape that the 4th dimension consists of relative to a cube is known as a tesseract, shown above.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract,explore2.gif
3,Universe,"The Universe is all of time and space and everything it contains. It consists of everything from planets, galaxies, and the solar system, to water, life, and the smallest subatomic particles. The Universe is approximately 91 million light years wide in diameter. This is the equivalent of 546,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 546 quintillion miles.",http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/the_universe/pr1998018b/large_web/,explore3.jpg
4,Galaxies,"A galaxy is a system of stars, dust, dark matter, and other types of mass. It is a system bounded by gravity and takes the form of either a spiral or an ellipse. Galaxies usually range from dwarf size (a few thousand stars) to giant size (100 trillion stars). At the center of every galaxy, there is to believed to be a black hole. The word galaxy derives from the greek word <i>galaxias</i>, meaning Milky. This is one of the reasons the galaxy Earth resides in is called the Milky Way.",https://www.bloglovin.com/blogs/universe-today-670877/amazing-new-x-ray-image-whirlpool-galaxy-2912607743,explore4.jpg
5,Stars,"A star is a bright sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. Stars shine due to a process called thermonuclear fusion where an element known as Hydrogen in the core of the star is converted into Helium which produces an immense amount of energy which is then projected into space. Stars have varying sizes, lives, and brightness depending on their mass. If a star is massive enough, at the end of its life, its core may collapse into a black hole.",https://www.pinterest.com/pin/531917405967189093/,explore5.jpg
6,Black Holes,"A black hole is a region of spacetime (the 4 dimensions that space and time consist of) that has such strong gravitational effects that nothing, including particles and light can escape from inside it. They sometimes form at the end of a stars life, when the mass of a star is so high that it collapses in on itself and creates a form of near infinite density. The boundary of the region of a black hole that nothing can escape from once passed is known as the event horizon. It is given this name because blackholes distort light and time so much, that any event that occurs within this region is incomprehensible and unable to be witnessed from outside it. The black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, known as Sagittarius A*, contains approximately 4.3 million solar masses, equivalent to 8.55 x 10<sup>36</sup> kilograms.",http://news.softpedia.com/news/Supermassive-Black-Holes-Grew-Most-Early-On-174818.shtml,explore6.jpg
7,Interstellar Cloud,"An interstellar cloud is an accumulation of gas, plasma, and dust in galaxies. These clouds consist of a variety of materials and elements, have varying temperatures, and have multiple other unique characteristics such as chemical composition, velocity of materials within them, radiation, and wavelengths. A common type of interstellar cloud is a Nebula.",http://www.space.com/14034-gallery-amazing-orion-nebula-photos.html,explore7.jpg
8,Planets,"A planet isa astronomical object orbiting a star. In order to be classified as a planet, an object needs to be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has no surrounding debris. The planet we live on, Earth, is one of eight planets that orbit the star commonly known as the Sun.",http://www.touristmaker.com/blog/all-about-the-equator/,explore8.jpg
9,Natural Satellites,"A natural satellite is a celestial body that orbits another celestial body of a greater mass, such as a planet, dwarf planet, or star. The object it orbits around is known as its primary. The most commonly known natural satellite is the moon that revolves around Earth. Earth is also a natural satellite, revolving around the sun.",http://www.core77.com/posts/25072/the-supermoon-is-coming-25072,explore9.jpg
10,Comets,"A comet is an icy small object in the solar system that, when passing close to the sun, heats up and begins to release dissolved gas, displaying a visible atmosphere or cluster of gas behind it that can look like a tail. The size of them can range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers wide and are composed of ice, dust, and small rocky particles.",http://www.decodedscience.org/can-comets-destroy-earth/3501,explore10.jpg
