        Look towards your nearest window. Gaze outside of it. Look up in the sky. What do you see? 
        The sun? The moon? A cluster of clouds? Or maybe even those millions of tiny shiny specks in the darkness you know of as stars? 
        These are all things that make up this incomprehensibly large, seemingly endless space called the Universe. For thousands of years, 
        humans of all cultures have studied this universe, many with different opinions on how it works. It started with us thinking the 
        universe revolved around us, every thing visible in the sky circling us as if we deserved to be the center of attention. Eventually though,
        we came to realize that we're as about as significant as a single grain of sand in the Sahara Desert.

        The universe has many aspects to explore; many scientists have a passion for exploring and unlocking the secrets of the universe. 
        Some people dedicate their whole lives to one particular thing, such as the theory of dark energy or a specific galaxy. While you 
        may hear about space and the things that reside beyond our earth, the only true way to experience the universe to its fullest, is to 
        seek out the knowledge and pursue its facts, beauty, and secrets on your own. Grab a telescope, pick up a book, or even keep clicking.
