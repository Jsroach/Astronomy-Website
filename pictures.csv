This phenomena sent out particles and a third radiation belt that traveled near Earth a few days later.,http://www.bt-images.net/incredible-universe/,pictures4.jpg
5,The Horse Head Nebula,"The Horsehead Nebula is a cloud of ionized-hydrogen in the constellation Orion. These clouds are lit from within by young, hot stars. The interstellar dust absorbs the light from part of the ionized cloud creating this beautiful contrast.",http://www.bt-images.net/incredible-universe/,pictures5.jpg
